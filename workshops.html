                   At CGC, we are not confined to a narrow set of technical skills. Instead, we strive to provide our members with a dynamic and versatile learning experience. 
                   Our guest workshops are a key step toward realising this vision. 
                   <br><br>
                   To date, we have hosted engaging and interactive sessions on 3D Modelling and Game Development using Roblox, 
                   conducted by skilled mentors and experienced enthusiasts in their respective fields.

                    These sessions were designed to be hands-on and beginner-friendly, allowing participants to explore core concepts, experiment with tools, 
                    and gain practical exposure beyond theoretical learning. Members had the opportunity to design 3D assets, understand game mechanics,
                    collaboratively build simple game environments, and get direct mentorship from notable agencies like Zoducts.

                    The workshops sparked strong enthusiasm among participants, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. 
                    <br><br>
                    As a result, 
                    many members developed a deeper interest in game design and digital creation, with several taking the initiative to explore these skills further independently. 
                    Overall, these sessions successfully reinforced CGC’s commitment to fostering innovation, curiosity, and multidimensional learning among its members.
