                    The Coding and Graphics Club was founded with a vision to encourage creativity, innovation, and collaboration among students 
                    who share a passion for technology and design. Over the years, we have transformed into a vibrant hub of ideas, where members 
                    are empowered to learn new skills and express themselves in unique ways.  
                    <br><br>
                    What started as a small group of enthusiasts quickly grew into a family of learners, creators, and problem-solvers. 
                    Today, CGC represents a community where students from different grades and backgrounds come together to merge their love 
                    for coding, art, and storytelling. Every project is a chance to inspire, and every meeting is an opportunity to grow.

                    At CGC, learning doesn’t stop at the basics. We dive deep into the world of programming languages, exploring not only 
                    how they function but also how they can be used creatively. From Python scripts to HTML websites and JavaScript-powered 
                    games, members are encouraged to explore, experiment, and challenge themselves.  
                    <br><br>
                    On the graphics side, students discover the power of visual storytelling. Using digital art tools, design software, and 
                    modern animation techniques, they learn how to turn ideas into eye-catching posters, logos, and short animations. 
                    This combination of coding and graphics ensures that members leave with a truly versatile skill set, prepared to take 
                    on future challenges both inside and outside the classroom.

                <p>
                    Beyond learning, the club provides a supportive space where members work together on real projects. These range from 
                    designing event posters and creating interactive websites to developing mini-games that can be enjoyed by the school community.  
                    <br><br>
                    Through collaborative teamwork, students not only sharpen their technical skills but also develop important life skills such 
                    as communication, leadership, and resilience. When members tackle a problem, they do so together — brainstorming solutions, 
                    sharing responsibilities, and celebrating achievements as a team. It is this sense of community that makes CGC much more than 
                    just an after-school activity.

                    Looking ahead, the Coding and Graphics Club envisions expanding its reach through larger school events, coding competitions, 
                    and creative showcases where students can present their projects to a wider audience. We aim to connect with like-minded 
                    organizations and foster collaborations that allow our members to gain exposure to real-world opportunities.  
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, CGC is not only about building skills but also about shaping the innovators of tomorrow. By encouraging curiosity, 
                    creativity, and a problem-solving mindset, the club nurtures students to become confident individuals ready to take on the 
                    challenges of a rapidly evolving digital world. Every member’s journey matters, and together, we are building a legacy that 
                    will continue to inspire future generations.
